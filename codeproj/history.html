                <h1>What is Ice Cream?</h1>
                <h2>Ingredients, How It's Made, and Best Storage Practices</h2>
            </ul>
            <p> Ice cream is a mixture of milk, cream, sugar, and sometimes other ingredients that has been frozen into a soft, creamy delight using special techniques. Ice cream has been a popular treat for hundreds of years but has only become commonplace since the widespread use of refrigeration. The exploding popularity of ice cream has led to a number of ice-cream variations including frozen custard, frozen yogurt, and even non-dairy versions made with ingredients like coconut milk.</p>
            <h3>Ice Cream Composition</h3>
            <p>In the United States, ice cream must contain 10 to 16 percent milk fat. Higher milk fat ice creams generally have a smoother texture because they contain a lower amount of water and, therefore, fewer ice crystals. Ice creams that contain less than 10% milkfat are referred to as "ice milk" or more popularly, "low fat" ice cream.</p>
            <p>In addition to milk or cream, ice cream often contains stabilizers, like gluten, to help keep the mixture a consistent texture. Sugar or sugar substitutes are usually added to provide the sweet flavor that most people expect. No-sugar-added varieties of ice cream have become popular and rely on the addition of fruit and milk's natural sugars for their subtle sweetness.</p>
            <p>The variety of flavors and additives in ice cream has kept its popularity strong with consumers. From tropical fruits like mango or less common ones like pomegranate to unconventional flavors like coffee or basil, thousands of ice-cream flavors, both savory and sweet, have been created over the years.</p>

            <h1>Chocolate Ice Cream</h1>
            <p>Chocolate was one of the first ice cream flavors, created before vanilla, as common drinks such as hot chocolate, coffee, and tea were the first food items to be turned into frozen desserts.Hot chocolate had become a popular drink in seventeenth-century Europe, alongside coffee and tea, and all three beverages were used to make frozen and unfrozen desserts.</p>

            <h1>Vanilla Ice Cream</h1>
            <p>Vanilla is frequently used to flavor ice cream, especially in North America, Asia, and Europe. Vanilla ice cream, like other flavors of ice cream, was originally created by cooling a mixture made of cream, sugar, and vanilla above a container of ice and salt. The type of vanilla used to flavor ice cream varies by location. In North America and Europe consumers are interested in a more prominent, smoky flavor, while in Ireland they want a more anise-like flavor.</p>
